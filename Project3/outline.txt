We created 2 new test in the main.cpp
1st test is to test if fetching all the data executes quickly and efficiently as the data are all next to each other
2nd test is a sort of stress test where you fetch a random data 10,000 times and see how fast it finishes

the test are located in main.cpp line 379 - 385 and the main.cpp file is included in the project3.zip

the Design Document is named DesignDoc.pdf and is also included in project3.zip
